We aim to quantitively evaluate and compare different psychological crowd modelling algorithms through the systematic exploration of  state of the art modelling techniques. 
The number of models to explore will be arbitrary, as our approach will be based on iteratively analysing and evaluating each model. Our starting point will be a fuzzy logic-based model, replicating OCEAN personality crowds, published in 2020 by [insert paper].
Each model will be analysed on both a conceptual level and a practical level. All models will perform the same tasks and be evaluated on similar metrics, thus creating both a systematic review and an quantitative result comparison.
Regarding the technologies used, provided each model might have different technological requirements, it is possible that we change our technology stack for different model implementations, keeping in mind the integral computational differences and dependencies between programming languages and frameworks.
As of today, there aren't many review papers in the are of psychological crowds modelling. We expect our results to have an impact in comparing different state of the art proposed models and that our thorough analysis and comparison can hopefully guide others towards an informed model choice in this hot topic.

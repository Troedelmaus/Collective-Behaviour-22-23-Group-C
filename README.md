Repository for group work in Collective Behaviour 22/23

Idea 1:  
- a continuation of the paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070320300242?via%3Dihub. Since it is a systematic literature review on crowd modeling and group dynamics from 2000-2020, we could further expand by adding interesting findings from 2020-2022 and compare their performance by mimicking the experience they used on the original paper for a more complete analysis of the state of the art techniques and their improvement compared to other more traditional ones, thus expanding the existent systematic literature review. Bear in mind that this would mean a lot of research and work which might not be clearly reflected upon in a maximum of 4 pages, unless we just assume the results from the other paper and simplify the systematic review to focus more on the timeline from 2020-2022. Work could be split among us by the different technical categories touched in the paper.

Idea 2:  
- a bit simpler but more area-focused, would be to do a systematic review of Psycological modeling of crowds, which is a hot topic of crowd modeling. This touches a lot of novel techniques and new areas which can be pretty interesting to explore and experiment upon. This relates to both https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070320300242?via%3Dihub and https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/239.
